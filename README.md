### Twitch Client ID / Client Secret

Enter your Twitch `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the plugin settings.

The plugin uses these credentials to get an IGDB access token automatically.

### New file location

Set the folder where the new game note is created.

If empty, the note is created in the vault root.

### New file name

Set the file name format.

The default format is `{{title}}`.

You can also use `{{DATE}}` or `{{DATE:YYYYMMDD}}`.

### Template file

Set the template file path used when creating a note.

If no template file is set, the plugin creates a note from the built-in metadata rendering.

### Show cover images in search

Show IGDB cover images in the search results.

### Open new game note

Open the created note automatically after selection.

### Cover image saving

Download and save the selected game cover inside your vault.

Use `{{localCoverImage}}` in your template if you want to embed the saved image.

### Cover image folder

Set the folder where downloaded cover images are stored.

## Advanced

### Templater

- This plugin replaces `{{variables}}` and date placeholders, but it no longer executes custom `<%= ... %>` expressions.
- Use the Templater plugin for loops, conditions, or any other scripting inside templates.
- If you want to render screenshots or add conditional sections, use Templater on top of the generated metadata.
